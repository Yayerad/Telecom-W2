## Data Workflow

1. **Data Acquisition:**
   - Raw customer data is imported into the pipeline for processing. Data includes demographics, service usage, and feedback metrics.

2. **Data Cleaning and Transformation:**
   - Handling missing values, normalization, and feature engineering.
   - Transforming categorical variables into model-ready formats.

3. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Creating relevant features to improve model accuracy, such as engagement indices and churn propensity scores.

4. **Machine Learning:**
   - Built, trained, and tested models to predict:
     - **Engagement Score:** Measures user activity.
     - **Experience Score:** Quantifies customer satisfaction with services.
     - **Satisfaction Score:** Overall rating of customer happiness.

5. **Database Export:**
   - Final processed data is exported to a PostgreSQL database.
   - Specific tables for metrics and predictions are synced with a MySQL instance.

6. **Deployment:**
   - The pipeline is containerized using Docker.
   - Integration with CI/CD pipelines ensures model updates can be tracked seamlessly.
